## Read data from online txt

Generate date series in format like '211106'

```{r}
beginDate = as.Date('2019-01-05')
endDate = as.Date('2021-11-06')

DateSeries = seq(beginDate,endDate,by = 7)

DateSeries = map(DateSeries, ~substr(str_replace_all(.x, "-", ""), 3, 99))

DateSeries[[1]]
```


```{r}
# first try
read_onlinedf = function(date){
  url = paste0("http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_", date, '.txt')
  df = read_delim(url, delim = ',')
  df
}


df_all = map_df(DateSeries, read_onlinedf)
# df = read_delim("http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_211106.txt", delim = ',')


fwrite(df_all, 'passenger.csv')
```


## Clean data

Read data

```{r cars}
passenger_df = read_csv('passenger.csv')
```

First Groupby

```{r}
# look at it
passenger_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(station == '59 ST', c_a == 'A002') %>% 
  arrange(division, scp, date, time)


# group by station and time (neglect infomation about unit/scp and ca)
passenger_df_cleaned = 
  passenger_df %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    mutate(entries = as.integer(entries),
           exits = as.integer(exits)) %>% 
    group_by(station, date, time) %>% 
    summarise(entries_sum = sum(entries),
              exits_sum = sum(exits),
              # ca_distinct = n_distinct(c_a),
              # unit_distinct = n_distinct(unit),
              # scp_distinct = n_distinct(scp))
             ) %>% 
    mutate(date = as.Date(date, "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% 
    arrange(station, date, time) %>% 
    ungroup()
    

```
Functions to give time period and passenger difference

```{r}
give_diff_period = function(df){
  df %>% 
    mutate(diff = entries_sum - lag(entries_sum),
           time_period = paste0(lag(time), '-', time)
           ) 
}

# try if Station '59 ST' work
df = 
  passenger_df_cleaned %>% 
    filter(station == '59 ST')

give_diff_period(df)

```

Nest data and map through all stations


```{r}
passenger_df_nested = 
  nest(passenger_df_cleaned, data = date:exits_sum)

passenger_df_final = 
  map_df(passenger_df_nested$data, ~give_diff_period(.x)) %>% 
  mutate(station = passenger_df_cleaned %>% pull(station)) %>% 
  relocate(station, date, time_period)
  

fwrite(passenger_df_final, 'passenger_cleaned.csv')
passenger_df_final
```
The diff contains some error, some super big some negative!!!




Left join some station info such as which line? which company?

```{r}
passenger_df_final = read_csv('passenger_cleaned.csv')
passenger_df_final %>% 
  group_by(station)
passenger_df_final
```
